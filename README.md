# Offroad_Segmentation_Training_Dataset_iou_0.8171
A deep learning solution for autonomous off-road navigation. Using PyTorch and U-Net, this project segments complex terrain like mud, gravel, and dense vegetation. Optimized with Mixed Precision (AMP) to achieve real-time inference on mobile GPUs. Overcomes data label noise through robust remapping and pre-processing of 689+ mask pairs.
